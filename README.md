Elasticsearch new low level [rest-client](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/current/java-rest.html) wrapper

## Why?

To quote ["State of the official Elasticsearch Java clients"](https://www.elastic.co/blog/state-of-the-official-elasticsearch-java-clients)

> The Java REST client is the future for Java users of Elasticsearch.

Because the legacy native client is a bit of a nightmare to deal with
(for many reasons) and the new REST client is quite capable.

Not to mention it supports some interesting features:

* compatibility with any Elasticsearch version

* load balancing across all available nodes

* failover in case of node failures and upon specific response codes

* failed connection penalization

* persistent connections

* trace logging of requests and responses

* optional automatic discovery of cluster nodes (also known as sniffing)

And it is quite fast already: See ["Benchmarking REST client and transport client"](https://www.elastic.co/blog/benchmarking-rest-client-transport-client)

## Goals

* Be minimal & performant

* RING inspired

* All "exotic" features should be optional

* Not a giant DSL over another DSL, just maps everywhere.
  Read ElasticSearch doc -> done, not another layer of indirection

* Provide minimal (and totally optional) utils to do the boring stuff
  (bulk, compose urls)

* Can do async via simple callbacks based api or `core.async`

* Provide [specs](https://github.com/mpenet/spandex/blob/master/src/clj/qbits/spandex/spec.clj)


We might provide a namepace with some sugar for common queries but
this will not be the default. It'll likely just be a bunch of
functions that operate on a query map accordingly.

**Here be dragons**

``` clojure

(require '[qbits.spandex :as s])

(def c (s/client {:hosts ["http://127.0.0.1:9200" "https://foo2:3838"]}))

;; add optional sniffer
(def s (s/sniffer c {... options ...}))


;; blocking
(s/request c {:url "/entries/entry/_search"
              :method :get
              :body {:query {:match_all {}}}})

>> {:body {:_index "entries", :_type "entry", :_id "AVkDDJvdkd2OsNWu4oYk", :_version 1, :_shards {:total 2, :successful 1, :failed 0}, :created true}, :status 201, :headers {"Content-Type" "application/json; charset=UTF-8", "Content-Length" "141"}, :host #object[org.apache.http.HttpHost 0x62b90fad "http://127.0.0.1:9200"]}

;; async: callback based
(s/request-async c {:url "/urls/url/"
                    :method :get
                    :body {:query {:match {:message "this is a test"}}}
                    :success (fn [response-as-clj] ... )
                    :error (fn [ex] :boom)})


;; async: as a clj.core.async/promise-chan
(async/<!! (s/request-ch c {:url "/urls/url/"
                            :method :get
                            :body {:query {:match {:message "this is a test"}}}}))

;; scrolling via core.async (fully NIO internally), interuptable if you async/close!
;; the returned chan
(async/go
  (let [ch (c/scroll-chan client {:url "/foo/_search" :body {:query {:match_all {}}}})]
    (loop []
      (when-let [page (async/<! ch)]
        (do-something-with-page page)
        (recur)))))



```

## API Docs

It's early days, so for now we have only [Codox generated docs](https://mpenet.github.io/spandex/qbits.spandex.html)
Or the [clj.specs](https://github.com/mpenet/spandex/blob/master/src/clj/qbits/spandex/spec.clj) if that's your thing:
